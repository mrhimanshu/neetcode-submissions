# You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.
# Given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:
# An integer x: Record a new score of x.
# '+': Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
# 'D': Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
# 'C': Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
# Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.
# Note: The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.
# Example 1:
# Input: ops = ["1","2","+","C","5","D"]

# Output: 18
# Explanation:
# "1" - Add 1 to the record, record = [1].
# "2" - Add 2 to the record, record = [1, 2].
# "+" - Add 1 + 2 = 3 to the record, record = [1, 2, 3].
# "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record = [1, 2].
# "5" - Add 5 to the record, record = [1, 2, 5].
# "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record = [1, 2, 5, 10].
# The total sum is 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18.
# Example 2:
# Input: ops = ["5","D","+","C"]

# Output: 15
# Explanation:
# "5" - Add 5 to the record, record = [5].
# "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record = [5, 10].
# "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record = [5, 10, 15].
# "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record = [5, 10].
# The total sum is 5 + 10 = 15.
